### Description 📝
Clima Weather App is a mobile application for weather forecasting with a simple and clean interface. This project is based on the skeleton code and basic project provided in [The App Brewery's Complete Flutter Development Bootcamp](https://www.appbrewery.co/), but it extends upon the basic functionality to offer more features and display enhancements.

### Features ✨
- Input any city to get the current weather.
- Utilizes location services to automatically detect and display weather for your current city.
- Provides weather forecasts for the next 5 days, with 3-hour intervals.
  
### Usage 🚀
To run the app:
1. Generate your API key from [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and add it to the commented code in the weather.dart file.
2. Initialize your emulated device (Android Studio, etc.) or connect your mobile device in developer mode.
3. Run the app from VS Code's debug mode.
